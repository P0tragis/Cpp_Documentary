# 🖥️ Core C Coding Practice

## 🚀 Greetings!

Welcome to my personal C coding lab! This folder is where I’ll be practicing C by intentionally working with broken or incomplete codes to strengthen my logic and problem-solving skills.  

Here, every error is a lesson, and every fix is progress. I’ll document what I learn along the way and slowly build confidence in C programming.

Happy debugging! 💻🔧
