# 🖥️ Core C Learning Journey

## 🚀 Greetings!

Welcome to my little corner of the C programming world! This folder is where I’ll be documenting my journey, experiments, and projects as I dive deeper into the fundamentals of C.  

C is tricky but exciting—it’s all about understanding how memory works, mastering pointers, and building things from the ground up. Here, I’ll record what I learn, mistakes I make, and small victories along the way.

## 🙏 Contribution & Feedback

This is primarily a personal learning space, but if you have tips, suggestions, or cool tricks, feel free to share! Every bit helps as I continue exploring and improving my C skills.

Happy Coding! 💻✨
