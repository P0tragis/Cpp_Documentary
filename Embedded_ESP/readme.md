# 💡 ESP32 Learning Journey

## 🚀 Greetings!

Welcome to my ESP32 playground! This folder is where I’m documenting my journey learning the basics of embedded systems. Right now, I’m focused on getting LEDs to blink, understanding pins, and learning how to control hardware step by step.  

In the future, I plan to explore **intermediate projects**, like building small automation systems, and even more **advanced projects**, like designing a plane with a working system! Every project here will be a learning step, from simple circuits to more complex creations.

## 🙏 Contribution & Feedback

This is my personal learning space, but I always welcome ideas, suggestions, or tips to make my experiments better.  

Happy tinkering! ⚡✈️
