# 💡 ESP32 Learning Journey

## 🚀 Greetings!

Welcome to my ESP32 playground! This folder is where I’m documenting my journey learning embedded systems. Right now, I’m starting with the **basics**, like blinking LEDs and understanding pins.  

As I progress, I’ll move on to **intermediate projects**, such as small automation systems, and eventually tackle **advanced projects**, like building a plane with a working system.
